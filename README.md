# Data-Analysis
This project delves into the behavioral patterns of Cyclistic bike usage between two distinct user groups: annual members (referred to as Subscribers) and casual riders (referred to as Customers), over the period of January to March 2019. Utilizing BigQuery to perform intricate data manipulations and Tableau for dynamic visualizations, I aim to highlight differences and draw insights into how these user types engage with the service differently.

Data Analysis and Preparation
The initial step involved querying a comprehensive cyclist dataset to extract and transform relevant data points for analysis using SQL.
Key calculations included:
1.Determining the ride duration for a precise measurement of engagement.
2.Extracting the day of the week to understand weekly usage patterns.
3.Filtering Subscriber data to ensure a balanced comparison with Customer records, enabling an equitable analysis between the two user groups.

Tableau Dashboard and Visualizations:
Average Time Spent per Month: This presents the average duration of rides for each user type across the three months, offering insight into how long users engage with the service in each session.

Weekly Comparison of Rides: By incorporating filters for each month and an aggregated view of all months, this visualization breaks down the number of rides per day of the week. It provides a clear comparison of usage trends between Subscribers and Customers, highlighting peak usage days.

Popular Stations Analysis: Two separate graphs display the most frequented 'to' and 'from' stations for both Subscribers and Customers, with the flexibility to filter by month or view across the entire quarter. This reveals spatial preferences and potential hotspots of activity for each user type.

Insights and Impact
Through the strategic combination of SQL data manipulation and Tableau's interactive visualizations, this project unveils nuanced differences in how annual members and casual riders utilize Cyclistic bikes. Whether it's the duration of rides, preferred days of the week for cycling, or favored stations, our analysis provides valuable insights that can inform marketing strategies, operational improvements, and customer engagement initiatives for Cyclistic.
